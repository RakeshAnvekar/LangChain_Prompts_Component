prompts are input instrctions or queries given to a model to guide its output

two types of prompts
text based prompts
multi model prompts (image,video,audio,)

promts ae so imp in which the outpit from the llm is directly depend o the prompts

if you are allowing static prompts it means you are allowing more control over the prompts


the point i thing is insted of prompts wy we cant use fstring
we can use f string aswell

the resson to use fprompt tenplete is

we bget by default validations
  by using the property called validatetemte=true
  wen we use this property
  explain with example

    validate_template=True,
    input_variables=["paper_input","style_input","length_input"],    this will not found in fstring

    prompts templstes can be reuse
    we can save the teplate as json file and we can use it across

    prompttemplete is fully tightly coupled with langchain ecosystem

    -----------------
    lanchain contain tree type of messages

    1) system messages
    2)humen 
    3) AI messagws

  HumanMessage is one tjose message wher user sends to llm
  like tell methe ca[ital of india
  AI messagws is one where llm sends to the user
  system message is system level message like you are the helpful assistet
  you are very knoleegeble dodcter
------------------

model has invioke methid
we can pass single message to invoke message when you wsnt to sed stand alone quey to llm 
this can be dne by sending ststic or dynamic one

anoter way to use invoke method is by ending lit of message,
used in multi turn concerstion

we know how we can send the way to send the stsic messages like system,humen,ai messages

Dynamic messages
ChatPromptTemplate
  
  this class uded to send the list of messages to llm

  for example if you have system message and you want that syatem message to have dynamic
  like you ae a helpfull {domain} expert

  A message place holder:

  a messagePlaceholder in langchain is a special placeholder used inside a ChatPromptTemplate to dnamically insert chat history or list of messages at run time



for ex:
you have comapny chat boat , user communicate with chat bot ,think there is an one user 
he asked to chat bot he need to refun on some perticular product. chat boat refund initiated and and chat bot replays amount will be refundd in 3 to 5 working days

think the situation the user didnot recice the refund
at the time user will come back and ask about the refund righ what is the stsuus of my refund 
at that time we need to track about previous concerstins aswell. 
when new sessons status then we injevt previous chat  histery yo the current conertions.this probme solves by message place hilder
